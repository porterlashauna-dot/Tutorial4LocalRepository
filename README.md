# Information-Technology-Fundamentals
GitHub! A place where inventors collaborate. 
This repository was created to show a record of our work with learning how to use the Python software. It has given us the opportunity to collaborate on a coding assessment using GitHub. 
Steps I followed to complete the tutorial: I started by creating a new public repository on GitHub. A README.md file was craete to document the project's purpose, steps and collaborations. I then added someone as a collaborator to view my pull request on GitHub. Files were added to the repository. I commit my code change and pushed the documents to the repository. Both collaborators reviewed each other's work and were able to submit their assignment on Moodle. 
Collaborators: Lashauna Porter and Quincy Hyacinth
